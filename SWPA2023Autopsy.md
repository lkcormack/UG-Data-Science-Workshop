# Autopsy of First Workshop
Notes and thoughts from the workshop done at the SWPA March 2023 conference in Frisco, TX.

Bring 1 or 2 grad student TAs (2 can share a room)

## Pre-workshop

- arrange good wifi ahead of time - do not assume!!!
- get student contacts early, and have them
  - create RStudio (Posit) account
  - download something from google drive (so they know how to do it
- tell them to show 5 to 10 min **early** or don't bother
- bring a laptop (chromebooks fine, tablets not so much)

## Session I - R/Rstudio/ggplot bootcamp

- watch-then-do chunks
    - make slightly larger
    - tell them to watch and listen, not take notes
    - then refer to pdf to actually code

- call out some really basic coding grammer
    - if there's a comma there, there should be one here
    - parentheses come in pairs
    - minus signs used for subracting only

## Session II - brainstorming and example workflows

- Make even more clear (sigh) that they should propose
    - one experiment
    - A/B or Y ~ X design (only)

We need to make our own proposal sheet (which was a really good idea, btw). 
One that has only 2 variables and emphasizes (and leaves room for) the sketch.

## Session III

Can't really think of any obvious improvements. 

Maybe some more space between tables so we can get to middle people more easily.
